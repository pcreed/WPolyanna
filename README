WPolyanna is a python library for reasoning about weighted clones.
It uses the libraries CDD and PuLP for polytope and linear 
programming computations, respectively.

Currently using python2.7. A python3 version will be forthcoming soon.

First install Pulp (http://code.google.com/p/pulp-or/) and pycddlib (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycddlib).

Run

python setup.py test

to make sure everything is working properly.

Then run 

python setup.py install

to install.

See the examples directory for some examples of how wpolyanna can be used
to reason about weighted polymorphisms.
